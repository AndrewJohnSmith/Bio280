Bio280
======

R scripts for the Bio280 honors section class are stored here.

These are examples that we can use to learn how phylogenetic comparative methods work.
We'll start by going through these as a class, then you can run your own datasets!

The data file examples contain some 'regime optimas' that are defined below.
Habitat - 1 = Benthic, 2 = Both, 3 = Pelagic
Feeding - 1 = No fish diet, 2 - Some fish diet, 3 = High fish diet.

You need to make your own classification regimes for your data.
